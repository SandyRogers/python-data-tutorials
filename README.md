# Introductory data handling, visualisation and machine learning in Python

Jupyter notebook tutorials for introductory data handling, visualisation and machine learning in Python.

To use these notebooks you'll need a [Python](https://www.python.org/) environment, and a few packages.
You can install these e.g. using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

```bash
pip install jupyterlab pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib openpyxl
```

You can then check out this repository and launch `jupyter lab` to see and use the Jupyter notebooks.
